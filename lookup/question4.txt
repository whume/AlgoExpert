You are given a matrix of integers field of size n × m representing a game field, and also a matrix of integers figure of size 3 × 3 representing a figure. Both matrices contain only 0s and 1s, where 1 means that the cell is occupied, and 0 means that the cell is free.

You choose a position at the top of the game field where you put the figure and then drop it down. The figure falls down until it either reaches the ground (bottom of the field) or lands on an occupied cell, which blocks it from falling further. After the figure has stopped falling, some of the rows in the field may become fully occupied.
